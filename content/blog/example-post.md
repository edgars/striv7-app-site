# Getting Started with API Gateway

Welcome to our comprehensive guide on setting up your first API Gateway. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the essential steps to get your gateway up and running.

## What is an API Gateway?

An API Gateway acts as a reverse proxy to accept all application programming interface (API) calls, aggregate the various services required to fulfill them, and return the appropriate result.

## Key Features

1. **Authentication and Security**
   - JWT validation
   - Rate limiting
   - IP whitelisting

2. **Traffic Management**
   - Load balancing
   - Circuit breaking
   - Request routing

3. **Monitoring and Analytics**
   - Real-time metrics
   - Error tracking
   - Usage analytics

## Getting Started

First, let's install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install @devapi/gateway
```

Then, create a basic configuration:

```javascript
const gateway = require('@devapi/gateway');

const config = {
  port: 3000,
  routes: [
    {
      prefix: '/api',
      target: 'http://backend:8080'
    }
  ]
};

gateway.start(config);
```

## Next Steps

In the following sections, we'll dive deeper into:
- Advanced configuration options
- Security best practices
- Performance optimization
- Monitoring and logging
