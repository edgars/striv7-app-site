    "content": "# A Mini Guide for Tech Professionals\n\nIn a technical interview, you‚Äôre being evaluated not just for your coding or system design skills‚Äîbut also for how you think, communicate, and collaborate.\n\nWhether you're walking through algorithms, whiteboarding a system, or discussing trade-offs, understanding the **body language of your interviewer** can give you an important edge. It tells you when to slow down, clarify, or even pivot your approach.\n\nHere‚Äôs a practical guide to help you read and respond to non-verbal cues in technical interviews.\n\n---\n\n## üë§ Interviewer‚Äôs Body Posture\n\n| **Posture** | **Possible Meaning** | **What to Do** |\n|-------------|----------------------|----------------|\n| Leaning forward | Curious, following your logic | Keep building your explanation |\n| Leaning back with arms crossed | Critical thinking or skepticism | Ask: *\"Would you approach this differently?\"* |\n| Head tilted slightly | Processing, intrigued | Dive a little deeper or give an example |\n| Sudden shift to upright posture | Surprise or concern | Clarify or backtrack carefully |\n| Hands on desk or laptop | Focused, ready to respond | Prepare for a follow-up question |\n\n---\n\n## üòä Facial Expressions\n\n| **Expression** | **Interpretation** | **How to React** |\n|----------------|--------------------|------------------|\n| Nodding while you speak | Agreement or understanding | Continue with confidence |\n| Furrowed brows | Confusion or doubt | Slow down, rephrase, or draw it out |\n| Raised eyebrows | Interest or surprise | Ask: *\"Does that direction make sense to you?\"* |\n| Neutral or flat expression | Passive listening or distraction | Re-engage with a question like *‚ÄúWould you like me to walk through an example?‚Äù* |\n\n---\n\n## üëÄ Eye Contact and Focus\n\n| **Eye Behavior** | **Meaning** | **Response** |\n|------------------|-------------|---------------|\n| Focused eye contact | Listening actively | Maintain rhythm |\n| Glancing away frequently | Distraction or multitasking | Keep answers concise, ask if they'd like more depth |\n| Eye contact drops after a statement | Potential disagreement | Politely invite feedback or alternative views |\n\n---\n\n## ‚úã Gestures and Interaction\n\n| **Gesture** | **Meaning** | **What to Do** |\n|-------------|-------------|----------------|\n| Typing or note-taking | You're giving valuable info | Keep it structured and clear |\n| Leaning in and pointing to screen/board | Deep engagement | Encourage technical dialogue |\n| Silence and stillness | Thoughtful evaluation or mental parsing | Let them think‚Äîdon‚Äôt rush to fill silence |\n| Scribbling or diagramming alongside you | Collaboration mode | Open up your thinking process verbally |\n\n---\n\n## üî• Signs You‚Äôre Doing Great\n\n- Interviewer **asks detailed follow-ups**  \n- They **mirror your gestures or tone**  \n- You hear comments like *\"That's interesting\"* or *\"Good point\"*  \n- They smile or show relaxed body language after a complex answer  \n\n**‚úÖ What to do:** Stay confident, but don‚Äôt speed up. Stay clear, methodical, and open to alternatives.\n\n---\n\n## üß† Conclusion: Adaptability is a Technical Skill Too\n\nTechnical interviews are not just about right answers‚Äîthey‚Äôre about **how you think, how you explain, and how you engage**. Paying attention to body language helps you tailor your communication, show empathy, and build rapport‚Äîeven in high-pressure environments.\n\nSo next time you're walking through a solution, **don‚Äôt just debug your code‚Äîdebug the room**.\n\n---\n\n*Want this as a printable cheat sheet for your next interview prep?

    "content": "# Getting Started with API Gateway\n\nWelcome to our comprehensive guide on setting up your first API Gateway. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the essential steps to get your gateway up and running.\n\n## What is an API Gateway?\n\nAn API Gateway acts as a reverse proxy to accept all application programming interface (API) calls, aggregate the various services required to fulfill them, and return the appropriate result.\n\n## Key Features\n\n1. **Authentication and Security**\n   - JWT validation\n   - Rate limiting\n   - IP whitelisting\n\n2. **Traffic Management**\n   - Load balancing\n   - Circuit breaking\n   - Request routing\n\n3. **Monitoring and Analytics**\n   - Real-time metrics\n   - Error tracking\n   - Usage analytics\n\n## Getting Started\n\nFirst, let's install the necessary dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install @devapi/gateway\n```\n\nThen, create a basic configuration:\n\n```javascript\nconst gateway = require('@devapi/gateway');\n\nconst config = {\n  port: 3000,\n  routes: [\n    {\n      prefix: '/api',\n      target: 'http://backend:8080'\n    }\n  ]\n};\n\ngateway.start(config);\n```\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIn the following sections, we'll dive deeper into:\n- Advanced configuration options\n- Security best practices\n- Performance optimization\n- Monitoring and logging\n\nStay tuned for more detailed guides on each of these topics!",
